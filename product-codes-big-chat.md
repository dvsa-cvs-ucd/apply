# Product codes and the question flow

## Big topic 1: per vehicle additional Qs
* We're going to go vehicle first on everything, so regardless of whether or not it impacts the application the user has arrived to make, we'll learn the minimum about each vehicle to accurately choose a code for every application.
* Intent is to get light vehicle details captured (IVA1C/MSVA/PMSVA) etc.
* How do we feel about expanding this for PSV, trailer, HGV e.g. number of axles / number of seats / DDA schedules etc.
* We may not get to it for VTG10 but we can explore a manual process for this.

### The big lists

It's going to be hard to get these tests to a single code without more vehicle info. A single price might be possible, but I think the code is crucial. There are others here e.g. 2/3 axle M3, VTG1/2 that we know about but these are a bit more involved:

* COIF –  'CDL'/ 'CDS' / 'CEL' / 'CES' / 'CFL' / 'CFS' / 'CGL' / CGS' / 'CHL' / 'CHS'
* 400B – '9GP' / '9HP' / '9IP' / '9JP' / '9KP'
* VTG10 - 'NVV' / 'NFV' / 'NPV' / '10I' / '10R'
* VTP5 – 'NFL' / 'NFS'
* IVA Mutual – 'YXZ' / 'YSZ'
* VTG59 – '00N' / '00M'?
* Tempo 100 – 'TES' / 'TEL'

## Big topic 2: out of hours testing

* Statistically, I'm lead to believe this is rare if not non-existent. What can we do to move this issue out of our scope?
* Suggestions include: charge / assign code assuming in-hours, have option for telephony to change and make additional charge later (???)

## Big topic 3: Karen's POV on a location question

* Is a "Are you taking your vehicle to a DVSA centre?" y/n enough?
